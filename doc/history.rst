 A history of Mindboggle
========================

Back in 1998, Arno Klein left Caltech to visit Cornell Medical School for a summer,
to learn a bit about human brain imaging.  Within a day of arriving, he witnessed
two medical students arguing over what regions of a young man's brain fMRI were
active.  To do this, they compared locations of BOLD signal in the young man's 
brain with what appeared to them to be corresponding locations in one dead, 
60-year French woman's half cerebrum from 20 years prior, the venerable Talairach 
atlas.  That clinched it.  Arno stayed on to create the initial Mindboggle software 
package in Matlab as part of his doctoral dissertation.

In 2007, he was invited to join the faculty at Columbia University
to continue its development, and with generous funding from the NIMH,
Arno assembled a team to tackle the problem anew.
