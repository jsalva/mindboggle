   DTI
      Diffusion tensor imaging.  DTI is rather poorly named, because
      it is a model of the diffusion signal, and an analysis method,
      rather than an imaging method.  The simplest and most common
      diffusion tensor model assumes that diffusion direction and
      velocity at every voxel can be modeled by a single tensor - that
      is, by an ellipse of regular shape, fully described by the length
      and orientation of its three orthogonal axes.  This model can
      easily fail in fairly common situations, such as white-matter
      fiber track crossings.

   DWI
      Diffusion-weighted imaging.  DWI is the general term for MRI
      imaging designed to image diffusion processes.  Sometimes
      reseachers use :term:`DTI` to have the same meaning, but
      :term:`DTI` is a common DWI signal model and analysis method.

   FMRI
      Functional magnetic resonance imaging!  It refers to MRI image
      acquisitions and analysis designed to look at brain function
      rather than structure.  Most people use FMRI to refer to
      :term:`BOLD` imaging in particular.  See the `wikipedia FMRI`_
      article for more detail.

   PET 
      Positron emission tomography is a nethod of detecting the
      spatial distributions of certain radiolabeled compounds -
      usually in the brain.  The scanner detectors pick up the spatial
      distribution of emitted radiation from within the body.  From
      this pattern, it is possible to reconstruct the distribution of
      radiactivity in the body, using techniques such as filtered back
      projection.  PET was the first mainstream technique used for
      detecting regional changes in blood-flow as an index of which
      brain areas were active when the subject is doing various tasks,
      or at rest. These studies nearly all used :term:`water
      activation PET`. See the `wikipedia PET`_ entry.

   voxel
      Voxels are volumetric pixels - that is, they are values in a
      regular grid in three dimensional space - see
      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel
