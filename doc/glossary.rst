    atlas
        Manual annotations of an individualâ€™s brain. (See "label")

    cortical surface
        The outer surface of the cerebrum, sometimes referred to as
        the "pial surface" or "cerebral exterior".

    fundus (pl: *fundi*)
        A curve traversing the bottom of folds of the cortical surface.

    gyrus (pl: *gyri*; adj.: *gyral*)
        Exterior portion of a fold of the cortical surface.
        The outermost protrusions are sometimes referred to as a
        "gyral crest" or "gyral crown".

    label
        An annotation of a region of the brain, such as when delineating
        the anatomical boundaries of a gyrus or sulcus.  This process is often
        called "parcellation" when labeling a surface such as the cortical surface.
        Labeling is distinct from "segmentation", which usually refers to
        breaking up dissimilar or clustering similar, contiguous points,
        for example tissue class segmentation into gray matter, *etc.*
 
    medial surface
        A surface running midway between two structures.  For example, 
        the medial surface for a sulcus fold lies between the banks of the 
        sulcus without intersecting the cortical surface.

    pit
        Local, deep, pit-like intrusion in a sulcus fold.

    optimal average template
        Aggregate image constructed by the iterative alignment of a set 
        of brain images.

    probabilistic atlas, n. 
        The probabilistic assignment of labels to a template, resulting 
        from the registration of a set of atlases to the template 
        (Example: a maximum probability atlas, optionally accompanied by an 
        image volume of probability values).

    sulcus (pl.: *sulci*; adj.: *sulcal*)
        *Syn.*: Crease, infolding, fissure, crevice, or intrusion of the brain
        surface.  Sometimes we loosely refer to a sulcus as a "fold".

    template
        An unlabeled reference, canonical, or average brain image 
        often used as a target for registration.

    voxel
        Voxels are volumetric pixels - that is, they are values in a
        regular grid in three dimensional space (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voxel).
