GRAPH FROM TRACTOGRAPHY

These methods compute the graphs from the results of the tractography.

Make target correlation graph computes the correlation between the tract masks as weight for the edge connecting two nodes (i.e. seed for tractography).
NOTE: the resulting graph is undirected

Make target correlation graph computes the probability of a connection from use seed to one target as weight for the edge connecting two nodes (i.e. seed for tractography).
NOTE: the resulting graph is directed
