			To do so, we simply go triangle by triangle and see if they are all from the same class.
			If yes, do nothing.
			If no, then add the nodes from the majority class (it'll be 2 to 1) to the label boundary.
			First, let us define an empty array to store the label boundaries.
			It will have zeros and ones. We can then define a new array to store all and only those nodes
