    Find anchor points.

    Assign maximum likelihood vertices as "anchor points"
    for use in constructing fundus curves.
    Ensure that the anchor points are not close to one another.

    ????
    Should perhaps change this code because of instability.
    Only the sulcus end points are necessary,
    so that the fundus doesn't shrink.

    Inputs:
    ------
    vertices: [#vertices x 3] numpy array
    L: fundus likelihood values: [#vertices x 1] numpy array
    min_directions: [#vertices x 1] numpy array
    thr: likelihood threshold
    min_distance: minimum distance

    Parameters:
    ----------
    max_distance: maximum distance

    Output:
    ------
    anchors: list of subset of surface mesh vertex indices
