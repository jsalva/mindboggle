    Find neighbors to a surface mesh vertex.

    For a set of surface mesh faces and the index of a surface vertex,

    index: index of surface vertex

    Output:
    ------
    N: list of indices of neighboring vertices

    Find anchor points.

    Assign maximum likelihood vertices as "anchor points"
    while ensuring that the anchor points are not close to one another.
    Anchor points are used to construct curves.

    Note: only the sulcus end points are strictly necessary

    ------
    vertices: [#vertices x 3] numpy array
