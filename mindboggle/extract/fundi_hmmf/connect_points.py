    Connect vertices in a surface mesh to create a curve.

    The goal of this algorithm is to assign each vertex a locally optimal
    Hidden Markov Measure Field (HMMF) value.

    We initialize the HMMF values with likelihood values normalized to the
    interval (0.5, 1.0] (to guarantee correct topology) and take those values
    that are greater than the likelihood threshold (1 for each anchor point).

    We iteratively update each HMMF value if it is near the likelihood
    threshold such that a H_step makes it cross the threshold,
    and the vertex is a "simple point" (its addition/removal alters topology).

    ------
    anchors: list of indices of vertices to connect (should contain >=2)
    faces: indices of triangular mesh vertices: [#faces x 3] numpy array

    neighbor_lists: lists of lists of neighboring vertices (optional: empty list)

    Parameters for computing the cost and cost gradients:
      wL: weight influence of likelihood on the cost function
      wN: weight influence of neighbors on the cost function
      H_step: the amount that the HMMF values are H_steped
    Parameters to speed up optimization and terminate the algorithm:
      min_H: minimum HMMF value to fix very low values
      min_change: minimum change in the sum of costs
      n_tries_no_change: #times the loop can continue even without any change
