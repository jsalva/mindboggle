Combined/eliminated Regions:


(1) Temporal (33) and frontal (32) poles, and bankstss (see note #1) regions eliminated, corresponding cortex absorbed by adjacent regions


(2) Caudal (2), isthmus (10), posterior (23), and rostral anterior (26) cingulate combined to form single cingulate region (2)
 
(3) Caudal (3) and rostral (27) middle frontal regions combined to form single middle frontal region (3)

(4) Opercular (18), orbital (19), and triangular (20) inferior frontal regions combined to form a single inferior frontal region (18). 

This is a perfectly reasonable aggregation of these regions and is the one reflected in the sulcus/region pairings below. An alternative breakdown would be to lump 19 with lateral orbitofrontal cortex (12) and use the anterior horizontal ramus of the sylvian fissure as the boundary between 18 and 12. Anatomically, both aggregations are defensible but one or the other may suit your needs better. 

Regarding my earlier note about the lack of a full, consistent sulcal anterior boundary for the inferior frontal gyrus: this will be the case for several regions, i.e., in practice, many boundaries are not formed by sulci but instead require “jumps” across gyri (paths along regions of different direction curvature). This can be variable, (e.g., the precentral sulcus is consistently formed by 2 or more disconnected components) or implicit in the definition of the boundary (e.g., the anterior boundary between orbital inferior frontal gyrus (19) and rostral middle frontal gyrus (27) requires a “jump” over the lateral orbital gyrus. Below, I note with a ‘*’ those boundaries given principally by a sulcal fundus but which frequently require “jumps” across gyri. I handle separately definitions that explicitly rely on non-fundal boundaries, i.e., those that rely on the margins of sulcal banks. 

(5) Parahippocampal + entorhinal cortex + and lingual gyrus?

________________
[1] This was eliminated b/c it spanned the superior temporal sulcus fundus and because the anterior boundary was ambiguous.

[2] The insula lies b/w these regions and is separated from them by the circular sulcus which is marked by an easily distinguished fold deep within the Sylvian fissure.

[3] This is the case in some, but not all, hemispheres. It occurs when the superior rostral sulcus fails to intersect with the cingulate sulcus.

[4] The pericalcarine region lies between these 2 regions. As defined in the “Regions bounded by sulcal margins” section below, the pericalcarine cortex (21) dorsal (with 5) and ventral (with 13) boundaries are formed by the lateral margins of the dorsal and ventral banks of the calcarine sulcus rather than a sulcal fundus; because this region spans the sulcal fundus, we cannot simply incorporate portions of the region into the adjacent regions based on the fundus.
