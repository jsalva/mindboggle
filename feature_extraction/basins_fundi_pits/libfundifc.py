    '''Skeletonize vertex clouds in my own algorithm from my own distance transformation
    
    This function is executed component by component (two vertexes are in the same component if they are in the same basin).
    The distance value of a vertex is
    the radius (Hamiltonian distance) of a circle that centers at the vertex and is tangent to the cloud, i.e., if the radius increase by 1,
    some vertexes inside the circle will not be fundus vertexes. 
    A *circle* from a vertex is a circle which centers at the vertex and of the radius the distance value of the vertex. 
    The skeletonization here is to find a set of vertexes, such that circles from those vertexes 
    can cover an entire (or most of) cloud within one component, for each component.  Well, necessary linking is needed. 
    
    For each component, sort distance values (obtained via myDT) of all vertexes. Label all vertexes as unvisited. 
    Begin from vertex X of the largest distance value. Call the vertex a seed. Label all vertexes that is within the circle from vertex X as visited and seeded from the vertex X. 
    Repeat this process on a vertex of the next largest distance value, until all vertexes are labeled visited and have recorded their seeds. 
    
    We can do line up later based on this result.
