 Download and install
======================

.. 1. setuptools is a dependency. 

.. sudo apt-get install python-setuptools

.. 2. I saw the follows on my Shell: 

.. package init file 'mindboggle/info/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)
.. package init file 'mindboggle/extract/fundi_from_pits/__init__.py' not found (or not a regular file)

.. 3. Now mindboggle is by default installed into my Python's ``root'' path, i.e., /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/

.. is there anyway that users can specify the installation path if they do not have root privilege? 


This page covers the necessary steps to install Mindboggle.

Download
--------

The project will be going public soon,
at which point we will provide a download link
and open up the github repository...

.. http://mindboggle.info/download

   To check out the latest development version::

       git clone git://github.com/binarybottle/mindboggle.git

Install
-------

Step 1: Install Mindboggle Python software
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can skip this step if you checked out the development version.
If you downloaded the source distribution named something like
``mindboggle-x.y.tar.gz``, then unpack the tarball, change into the
``mindboggle-x.y`` directory and install mindboggle using::

    python setup.py install

.. note::

    Depending on permissions you may need to use ``sudo``.

Step 2: Compile C++ code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Move the mindboggle_cpp directory to wherever you install your software
(let's call it YOUR_SOFTWARE_PATH), then run cmake and make::

    mv mindboggle_cpp YOUR_SOFTWARE_PATH
    cd YOUR_SOFTWARE_PATH/mindboggle_cpp/bin/
    cmake ..
    make

Alternatively, instead of "`>> cmake ..`", it may be better to run::

    ccmake ..

and select the appropriate architecture.  For example, on a Mac
you might not be able to compile x86_64 (particularly if using
the free academic version of the Enthought Python Distribution),
so in ccmake one would set::

    CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=i386

Step 3: Set environment variables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For your system to recognize the C++ code we just compiled,
include the following lines in your system's equivalent to a .bashrc file::

    MINDBOGGLE_CPP=YOUR_SOFTWARE_PATH/mindboggle_cpp/bin

    export PATH=$PATH:$MINDBOGGLE_CPP

Temporary:
For your system to recognize the path to Mindboggle, also
include the following lines in your system's equivalent to a .bashrc file::

    MINDBOGGLE=YOUR_SOFTWARE_PATH/mindboggle/mindboggle

    export PATH=$PATH:$MINDBOGGLE

Step 4: Move directory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To take advantage of the FreeSurfer_ software, move the contents of the
data/ directory to FreeSurfer's subjects/ directory, and make sure that
the environment variable SUBJECTS_DIR is set in your system's equivalent
to a .bashrc file::

    mv data/* $FREESURFER_HOME/subjects/

Dependencies
------------

Below is a list of required dependencies, along with additional software
recommendations.

Must Have
~~~~~~~~~

Basic compilation software::
  - cmake (http://cmake.org)
  - C++ compiler such as gcc

`Visualization Toolkit`_

Python_ 2.6 -2.7

Nipype_ 1.0
  Neuroimaging software pipeline framework

Nibabel_ 1.0
  Neuroimaging file i/o library

NumPy_ 1.3 - 1.6

SciPy_ 0.7 - 0.10
  Numpy and Scipy are high-level, optimized scientific computing libraries

NetworkX_ 1.0 - 1.4
  Python package for working with complex networks

.. note::

    Full distributions such as EPD_ or pythonxy_ provide the above packages,
    except nibabel_ and nipype_.  The EPD_ also includes the following
    strongly recommended libraries::

        IPython_ 0.10.2 - 0.12
          Interactive python environment. This is necessary for some parallel
          components of the pipeline engine.

        Matplotlib_ 1.0
          Plotting library

        Sphinx_
          Required for building the documentation

        `Graphviz <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_
          Required for building the documentation

Strong Recommendations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

FreeSurfer_
  FreeSurfer version 4 and higher
  This software will help to initialize labels for Mindboggle
  and generates the directory tree that Mindboggle uses to call
  subject data.
